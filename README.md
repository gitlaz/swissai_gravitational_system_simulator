Gravitational System Simulator

This code is designed to analyze, clusterize and synthesize gravitational systems - think solar systems, planetary systems, or moon systems - where you have a central body (like a star or planet) with multiple objects orbiting around it.

The Complete Pipeline

Step 1: Analysis → Step 2: Clustering → Step 3: Synthesis ↓ ↓ ↓ Study real systems → Group similar ones → Generate new ones Quality Control Features

What the Code Does (In Simple Terms)
The Big Picture:
The code takes data about orbiting objects (like planets around a star) and analyzes the entire gravitational system as a whole, rather than looking at individual objects. It's like studying the "family dynamics" of a solar system instead of just individual family members.
The Input Data:

a = How far each object orbits from the center (like Earth being 93 million miles from the Sun)
r = How big each orbiting object is (like Earth's radius)
total_mass = How heavy each orbiting object is
system_number = Which gravitational system each object belongs to

What It Analyzes
1. System Architecture:

How spread out are the orbits? (compact like inner planets vs. extended like outer planets)
Are the orbits evenly spaced or clustered together?
How many objects are orbiting the central body?

2. Mass Distribution:

Is there one dominant massive object (like Jupiter in our solar system)?
Or are masses more evenly distributed?
What's the total mass of all orbiting objects?

3. Physical Properties:

How dense are the orbiting objects?
What are their sizes and compositions?
How do size and mass relate to orbital distance?

4. Gravitational Interactions:

How crowded are the orbits? (Could objects gravitationally interfere with each other?)
What's each object's "sphere of influence"?
Are the systems stable long-term?

Key Features It Creates
The code transforms individual object data into system-level characteristics, like:

Orbital Compactness: How tightly packed the system is
Mass Hierarchy: Whether one object dominates or masses are equal
Orbital Regularity: Whether orbits are evenly spaced (like a well-organized system)
Formation Patterns: Whether massive objects tend to be closer or farther from the center

The Goal
This analysis helps understand:

What makes gravitational systems stable vs. unstable
Different types of system architectures (compact vs. spread out, dominated vs. democratic)
Patterns that might reveal how these systems formed
Whether systems follow certain "rules" of gravitational organization

Think of it like analyzing different types of families - some have one dominant parent, others are more equal; some live close together, others are spread out. The code finds these patterns in gravitational "families" of orbiting objects.
Real-World Application:
This could be used to study exoplanet systems (planets around other stars), analyze asteroid families, or understand moon systems around planets - basically any situation where multiple objects orbit a central body under gravity's influence.Wiederholenimport pandas as pd

What This Code Does (In Simple Terms)
The Big Picture:
If the first code was like studying individual solar system "families," this code groups those families by similarities - like finding that some families are "compact and crowded" while others are "spread out with one dominant member."
The Process:
1. Data Loading & Preparation

Takes the same gravitational system data as before
Optionally includes our Solar System as a reference point (like having a known family to compare against)
Creates system-level characteristics from individual object data

2. Feature Engineering
The code creates detailed "personality profiles" for each gravitational system:
Orbital Architecture:

How spread out are the orbits? (compact vs. extended)
Are orbits evenly spaced or irregular?
Do orbital distances follow patterns (like a geometric sequence)?

Population Characteristics:

How many objects orbit the central body?
What's the size diversity of the orbiting objects?
Are masses distributed evenly or dominated by one big object?

Formation Signatures:

Do heavier objects tend to be closer or farther from center?
How do size and mass relate to distance?
What does this tell us about how the system formed?

3. Clustering Analysis
The code uses multiple algorithms to group systems:
K-Means: Divides systems into a predetermined number of groups
Gaussian Mixture: Finds natural groupings with fuzzy boundaries
Hierarchical: Builds a "family tree" of system relationships
DBSCAN: Finds dense clusters and identifies unusual outliers
4. Finding the "Right" Number of Groups
Like asking "how many different types of families are there?" the code uses several methods:

Elbow Method: Finds the sweet spot where adding more groups doesn't help much
Silhouette Analysis: Measures how well-defined each group is
Calinski-Harabasz: Another measure of group quality

5. Analysis & Visualization
Solar System Context: If included, shows which group our Solar System belongs to and what other systems are similar to ours
Cluster Archetypes: Identifies distinct "types" of gravitational systems, like:

"Compact, multi-body systems with regular spacing"
"Extended systems dominated by one massive object"
"Dense, crowded systems with many small objects"

Key Features This Creates
System Archetypes: Different "flavors" of gravitational systems
Solar System Benchmark: If included, shows what makes our solar system typical or unique
Pattern Recognition: Identifies the fundamental organizational principles of gravitational systems
Real-World Applications
Exoplanet Research: Group newly discovered planetary systems by type
Solar System Evolution: Understand what "family" our Solar System belongs to
Astrobiology: Identify which types of systems might be most likely to harbor life
Planetary Formation: Understand the different pathways that create gravitational systems
The Toggle Feature
The code has a crucial INCLUDE_SOLAR_SYSTEM setting:

True: Includes our Solar System in the analysis (validation mode)
False: Analyzes only the unknown systems (pure discovery mode)

Why This Matters
Instead of looking at each gravitational system individually, clustering reveals the fundamental patterns that govern how these systems organize themselves. It's like discovering that all families, despite their differences, fall into recognizable categories based on their structure, dynamics, and formation history.
This prepares for Step 3 where the code will generate new, realistic gravitational systems based on these discovered patterns.Wiederholenimport pandas as pd

What This Code Does (In Simple Terms)
The Big Picture:
If the clustering code (previous) was like identifying different "family types" of solar systems, this code is like an AI artist that can create entirely new families that look and behave like the real ones, but have never existed before.
The Three-Part Process
CHUNK 1: Pattern Learning & Distribution Fitting
What it does: Studies the "blueprints" of each gravitational system family type
Key Components:

Pattern Extraction: Analyzes each cluster to understand what makes systems in that group similar
Distribution Fitting: Uses advanced statistics (Gaussian Mixture Models, Kernel Density Estimation) to learn the "recipe" for each type of system
Correlation Analysis: Understands relationships like "do heavier planets tend to orbit closer or farther from their star?"

Real-world analogy: Like studying thousands of different house designs and learning the architectural patterns - "Victorian homes typically have these window styles, Tudor homes use these materials," etc.
CHUNK 2: System Generation & Validation
What it does: Actually creates new gravitational systems following the learned patterns
System Architecture Generation:

Decides how many planets/objects the system should have
Determines how spread out or compact the orbits should be
Sets whether one object dominates (like Jupiter) or masses are more equal

Individual Body Creation:

Places each object at realistic orbital distances
Assigns masses based on the system's hierarchy pattern
Determines sizes that make physical sense

Physics Validation:

Checks that orbits don't overlap dangerously
Ensures objects aren't so close they'd be torn apart by tidal forces
Validates that the system would be stable over millions of years

CHUNK 3: Quality Control & Export
What it does: Ensures the generated systems are high-quality and exports them for use
Quality Metrics:

Confidence Scoring: How well does this match the training patterns?
Physics Validation: Does this obey the laws of orbital mechanics?
Reference Benchmarking: How similar is this to our Solar System or other known systems?

Multiple Generation Attempts: Tries several times per system and picks the best result
Comprehensive Export: Creates CSV files, visualizations, and detailed quality reports
Key Features
